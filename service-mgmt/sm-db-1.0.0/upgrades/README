The SM database can be generated off of an excel spreadsheet
(cgcs-root/stx/stx-ha/service-mgmt/sm-db-1.0.0/database/sm_database.xlsb)

Instructions:
1. Update the SM excel spreadsheet (sm_database.xlsb) with your changes,
2. Update the SM database (sm.db.v1) with your changes:
	sqlite3 sm.db.v1
	.tables
    apply our changes using SQL statements
    record the SQL statements for Crucible review (i.e. in commit.txt and in Crucible)
    .quit
3. Update Packstack "sm-configure" calls were appropriate.
4. Update Packstack "sm-provision" and "sm-deprovision" calls were appropriate.
5. If your service runs during Packstack manifest apply, you may need to make
   sure it is stopped before SM takes over.
